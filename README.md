Introduction
-------------
Hello players, so as you might know, this repository contains all the
sources for ASkyBlock or known as SkyBlock, that 'A' in this context
means nothing so do not even bother it. Okay so, this repo is the first
SkyBlock game for NukkitX, and the work behind this excellent work is
from tastybento, he deserved to be credited as this code contains almost
all of his work, "Almost".

But we welcome you to contribute to our code. Anyways, as I speak, this
repository is the first SkyBlock project for Nukkit and open-sourced. We
welcome you to help us code. This project is not owned by
[GLaDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS) so we cannot just do
everything you asked.

Alright so we are between banks here, so make those cheque into cash,
into my PayPal account.
