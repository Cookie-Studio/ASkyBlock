Introduction
-------------
Hello players, so as you might know, this repository contains all the
sources for ASkyBlock or known as SkyBlock, that 'A' in this context
means nothing so do not even bother it. Okay so, this repo is the first
SkyBlock game for NukkitX, and the work behind this excellent work is
from tastybento, he deserved to be credited as this code contains almost
all of his work, "Almost".

But we welcome you to contribute to our code. Anyways, as I speak, this
repository is the first SkyBlock project for Nukkit and open-sourced. We
welcome you to help us code. This project is not owned by
[GLaDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS) so we cannot just do
everything you asked.

So anyway, we're between banks right now, just make those checks out to cash,
into my PayPal account.

Installation
-------------
To install this plugin, you must at least have [DbLib](https://nukkitx.com/resources/dblib.12) plugin installed.
Therefore, you may download the latest version of ASkyBlock in my [Jenkins-CI](https://jenkins.potatohome.xyz/job/ASkyBlock/) and drop both DbLib and ASkyBlock files into `/plugins` folder in your server.
